The past two days were very interesting. I ended up going downtown to work with some people from our team and some external creatives. We worked at Brightlane coworking space. It made me really miss the time at Shopify head office and really dread going back to work on Monday. 

There is something so captivating about sessions like that where you are sitting way above all the details trying to carve out the identity and direction the brand needs to take. To find the unique value proposition and who may be looking for that. 

I met three incredible talented creatives who have incredible amounts of experience in the agency world. Working with any major brand that you can think of. It was encouraging to feel that we could discuss through some of these concepts and ideas with them and to have ideas well received.
